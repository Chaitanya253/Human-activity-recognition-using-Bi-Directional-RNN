# Human-activity-recognition-using-Bi-Directional-RNN
Human Activity Recognition using Bi-Directional RNN identifies human actions from sensor data by analyzing sequences in both forward and backward directions. This dual processing improves accuracy by capturing full temporal context, enabling precise activity detection in real time.rtphone-based applications.
